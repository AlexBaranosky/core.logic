   - [ ] making a much smaller scenario than zebra, say 2
   - [ ] Fix bug with the way that unification works
         It seems to me like unification isn't failing fast enough
         On the zebra problem we're getting exponential explosion of possiblities
         in the fix-unification branch. In the master branch we're not seeing
         this at all.

         SAMPLE OUTPUT master vs. fix-unification

         LEAD : weird behavior between Sequential and LCons protocols, particularly
         confusing because Collections are extended to LConsSeq, whoa

         the on-right-o unifiction is not merging the norwegian and blue, tho it seems to work for all
         others?
